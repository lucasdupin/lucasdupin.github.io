      South Experiment is a project created with the purpose of generating all the videos for 2014's TED Global conference.  
      I am proud of participating on two of them: *Main Video (South!)* and *Mighty Spaces*.  
      My role as a multimedia designer was mainly to create the visuals and animations based on the input data received.  
      You can read more below.

      Thanks to *[Black Magic](http://www.itsblackmagic.com)* to make it possible.

      ##South!
      <div class="columns">
      The idea was to combine technology and art to generate an unique expression of South American culture.  
      <br>
      The project is a combination of three components:
      <br>
      <ul>
      <li>GeoTIFF terrain data from South America</li>
      <li>Visuals programming using WebGL, Node.js and 2D Canvas</li>
      <li>South American designs and illustrations</li>
      </ul>

      Using NASA's terrain data from several places in South America, I reconstructed the terrain geometry using GeoTIFF color depth.  
      <br>
      The camera navigation was accomplished using sine and cosine waves, combined with vector math. On top of that some texture scroll helped to make the terrain feel alive.  
      <br>
      For the last scene, Vector Buffers made the animation smooth.

      ## Mighty Spaces

      <div class="columns">
      It started with a custom kite with tracking devices attached. We asked a kid to fly the kite, which is one of the most popular activities for kids to do in South America.  

      As he flew it, we were able to save the device's data in a text stream.  
      This stream was the base for plotting the kite's movement into a 3D scene, built with WebGL.  
      <br>
      My part here was to write the socket stream receiver, translate the data into a mesh, animate and render it.

      For this job I joined R/GA to build an WebGL interface for Google.  
      We chose WebGL since we were targeting web techonologies, and after all... it makes sense for a Google project, right?  
      The deadline was insane, we had to finish it in whithin 1 week. Fortunately it went really well...
      <br><br>
      Three.js helped me a lot here, I could concentrate on the user interface since the boring texture mapping stuff was already done \o/

      Last year I was invited by Red Bull to join their technology project as a curator.  
      This project was the Red Bull Digital Academy.

      For me it was a great opportunity to work with other developers, giving them a chance to have their projects sponsored by Red Bull.  
      We've been through a mentorship schedule, guiding the selected idea to its final conclusion, and of course, having a party in the end!

      The project website is in portuguese: http://www.redbulldigitalacademy.com.br/

      I feel really proud when projects go beyond advertisement.  
      This time we took part in a Nike event to help people experience their product's new features and to exercise!  
      <br>
      To win this game you need to prentend you're running as fast as you can! Each step will give you 1 point and you'll have 30 seconds.  
      There was a live ranking where you could check your score and compete with other guys who attended to the event.

      We used:
        * OpenFrameworks
        * OpenCV
        * RFID wristbands for ID
        * Depth cameras (Kinect)
        * Big TVs
        * 9 laptops

     This job might seem simple at first but it's anything but that.  
     We've build an interactive streamming for showing people how tomatoes are cultivated in Unilever's farm in Chile.

     Our structure included:
     * 2 farmers with cameras on top of their hats
     * One camera tracking the sun's position and taking snapshots for a timelapse
     * Spotify integration that lets you choose the currently playing music in the farm.

     And that's just the tip of the iceberg, to make this happen we needed to:
     * Write *ruby* scripts to monitor and take snapshots of the cameras
     * Trigger *After Effects* rendering through *command line*
     * Convert videos to web formats using *ffmpeg* on demand
     * Schedule *cron* tasks
     * Remotely access and monitor the operation

     This is a Black & White video due to agency visual language but I promise you, the site was quite green and red =]

      Teaching how to read is something magical. 
      Teaching how to read in a third world country makes you feel a better person.  
      This was the challenge, teching in a large scale, so, we developed a book companion app to make storytelling more pleasant for kids.

      For this project we chose Corona/Lua as our programming environment to have a flexible UI framework (as if in a game) and tweaked it untill we got the best user experience.  
      Corona also let us develop crossplatform with ease, still enabling us to build native plugins.
